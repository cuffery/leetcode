# Grinding Leetcode

Update: Nov, 2023

Language of choice: Python3

## Context
A catch-all treasure trove of my Leetcode submissions, study plan(s), and notes on algorithms and random nuggets of info. 

## Plan
Based on https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/
### Week 1 - Sequences
In week 1, we will warm up by doing a mix of easy and medium questions on arrays and strings. Arrays and strings are the most common types of questions to be found in interviews; gaining familiarity with them will help in building strong fundamentals to better handle tougher questions.
### Week 2 - Data Structures
The focus of week 2 is on linked lists, strings and matrix-based questions. The goal is to learn the common routines dealing with linked lists, traversing matrices and sequence analysis (arrays/strings) techniques such as sliding window, linked list traversal and matrix traversal.
### Week 3 - Non-linear Data Structures
The focus of week 3 is on non-linear data structures like trees, graphs and heaps. You should be familiar with the various tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) algorithms and graph traversal algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first search. In my experience, using more advanced graph algorithms (Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall) is quite rare and usually not necessary.
### Week 4 - More Data Structures
Week 4 builds up on knowledge from previous weeks but questions are of increased difficulty. Expect to see such level of questions during interviews. You get more practice on more advanced data structures such as (but not exclusively limited to) heaps and tries which are less common but are still asked.
### Week 5 - Dynamic Programming
DP questions can be hard to master and the best way to get better at them is... you guessed it - practice! Be familiar with the concepts of memoization and backtracking.

Practically speaking the return of investment (ROI) on studying and practicing for DP questions is very low. Hence DP questions are less important/optional and you should only do them if you have time to spare and you're very keen to have all bases covered (and interviewing with Google).
