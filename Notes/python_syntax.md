# Python Syntax Notes
...notes on python default functions, syntax that I have to look up. Keeping them in one place for ease of reference

## Functions
- `for loop`: `for i in range(10)` loops over `0` to `9`
- `IF`: `if...and...`

## Data Structures
- list v. dict: 
    - list is created using `[]` while dict by `{}`; 
    - list can do **list comprehension**
- hash table: can be built using a dict (see [Two Sum](../Code/Python/1_TwoSum.py))
